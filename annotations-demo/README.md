# Annotations

* __Information for the compiler__ — Annotations can be used by the compiler to detect errors or suppress warnings.
* __Compile-time__ and deployment-time processing — Software tools can process annotation information to generate code, XML files, and so forth.
* __Runtime processing__ — Some annotations are available to be examined at runtime.
